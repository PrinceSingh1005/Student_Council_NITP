          "True leadership extends beyond authorityâ€”it's about fostering a
          vision, making tough decisions, and empathizing with others.  Believe in your ability to create positive
          change, for success is not final, and failure is not fatal. Remember, leadership is about service,
          courage, and the relentless pursuit of a better future. Be the
          catalyst for positive transformation, and your impact will be
          enduring."
